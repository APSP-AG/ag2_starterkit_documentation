## Description

The AG2 Analog Pressure Sensor is designed to offer seamless integration with microcontroller setups, providing reliable and accurate pressure readings. This starter kit is outfitted with a fundamental Arduino code that facilitates easy interfacing with the sensor, along with a user manual that guides you through the setup and utilization process.

## Contents

- **Arduino Code** - This folder contains an Arduino sketch, which serves as a jumping-off point for interfacing with the AG2 Analog Pressure Sensor. It is well-documented and encompasses functions for initializing the sensor, reading analog voltage, calculating the pressure, and outputting the data to the serial monitor.
- **User Manual** - A manual presenting guidelines on how to effectively set up and use the AG2 Analog Pressure Sensor Starter Kit.

## Installation

To get started with the AG2 Analog Pressure Sensor, clone this repository to your local system. Navigate to the main page of the repository, click on "Code", followed by "Download ZIP". Unzip the contents to your preferred location.

## Usage

Begin by opening the `.ino` file located in the Arduino code folder with your Arduino IDE. Proceed to upload it to your Arduino board. Upon successful uploading, the code will initiate data reading from the sensor, displaying the results on the serial monitor for your observation and analysis.
